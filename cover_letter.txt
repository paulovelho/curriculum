It's a great pleasure to participate of a Google's job Applying Process. Like 90% of TI developers, working on Google is a dream that I hope to realize soon.
I've learned to read by myself with only 4 years old and completed my bachelor with 20 years old.
I've been using many of Google's APIs in my projects and in the companies I've worked. In my actual job - LabOne - I have developed an application using Google Maps and Google Gears for São Paulo subway controller company, working in a station visited by more than 80000 people every day. Before that, in my last company, I've developed a solution for IPT (an institute of research from a public university here in São Paulo), using Google Mini Appliance in a researching application through thousands of books and documents.
I've deep technical programming skills delivering always simple but creative solutions, very experienced in Object-Oriented Programming, who loves working in frameworks and APIs. I've even made a Google Maps framework to work in my projects with features like range definition, specific visualization controls and other improvements.
Thank you for the attention given. I'm very disposed to go wherever be necessary to work on Google.
Respectfully yours,
Paulo Henrique
