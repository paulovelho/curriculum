          Building the banking application was the biggest task I did during my period at Savedo.<br/>
          Since the beginning, we decide to use the modern technologies and languages in order to build a platform that could grow healthy and with high-end features.<br/>
          We developed a full front-end application to interact with a back-end API.<br/>
          The application was built with Angular 1.0 and Ionic built over Typescript. The whole project was full covered with tests provided by <i>mocha</i> framework. The communication with the main servers were following all the jsonapi patterns.<br/>
          API was built in Ruby on Rails. Although I was not responsible for the inner engines of the API (backend), it was not rare for me to put my hands on the server code to fix/build something.<br/>
