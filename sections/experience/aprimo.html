          As a Technical Consultant, my roles at Aprimo-Teradata were to give customer support and analyse and develope the required customizations.<br/>
          Aprimo is now part of the Teradata Company. In spite of my previous jobs, I could have the experience working in a multinational company, present in most of European countries. As part of my job, I had to make some travels, including spending some months in United States and visiting clients in other european countries.<br/>
          I also had the oportunity to work with huge projects and clients, such as JPMorgan, Nokia, Campbells and others.<br/>
