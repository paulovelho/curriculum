          The biggest client I've worked with during my time in Alpar was Smiles.<br/>
          <b>Smiles</b> is a loyalty frequent-flyer program that gave all the challenges to deal with a big company while still working in a small startup and a closely bonded team.<br/>
          Due to the big size of <b>Smiles</b>, I could work in a lot of different projects, since the main website, which was a Java Liferay application, to internal systems that used angular, and even a foreign website React-based.<br/>

          Another project that I was responsible during my time at Alpar was an Ionic mobile application.<br/>
          This project was for another big company, that already had a web-based application for managing HR related requests, such as vacations and sick days. The company ordered a low-budget simple app for the managers to get notifications on their mobile when an employee requested anything.<br/>
          The solution was to create an Ionic application that loads the web-based responsive website in a WebView and manages through Firebase the devices and authentication information for each user, therefore sending the push notifications when necessary.
