      Element Wave is a product from Element Software.<br/>
      It's a SDK and API for mobile applications that allows the programmers and companies trace their apps, getting informations as time of usage, locations, custom events and - specially - send push notifications for the users.<br/>
      At the time I started working there, it was a company with only 7 employees (including the owner and the team of 3 programmers).<br/>
      As a potential start-up with a great idea, the job was challenging and fun.
